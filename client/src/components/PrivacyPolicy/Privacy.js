        <strong>In Short:</strong> If you choose to register or log in to our
        services using a social media account, we may have access to certain

      </p>
      <p>
        Our Website offers you the ability to register and login using your
        third-party social media account details (like your Facebook or Twitter
        logins). Where you choose to do this, we will receive certain profile
        information about you from your social media provider. The profile
        information we receive may vary depending on the social media provider
        concerned, but will often include your name, email address, friends
        list, profile picture as well as other information you choose to make
        public on such social media platform.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will use the information we receive only for the purposes that are
        described in this privacy notice or that are otherwise made clear to you
        on the relevant Website. Please note that we do not control, and are not
        responsible for, other uses of your personal information by your
        third-party social media provider. We recommend that you review their
        privacy notice to understand how they collect, use and share your
        personal information, and how you can set your privacy preferences on
        their sites and apps.
      </p>
      <h2>6. WHAT IS OUR STANCE ON THIRD-PARTY WEBSITES?</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>In Short:</strong> We are not responsible for the safety of any
        information that you share with third-party providers who advertise, but
        are not affiliated with, our Website.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Website may contain advertisements from third parties that are not
        affiliated with us and which may link to other websites, online services
        or mobile applications. We cannot guarantee the safety and privacy of
        data you provide to any third parties. Any data collected by third
        parties is not covered by this privacy notice. We are not responsible
        for the content or privacy and security practices and policies of any
        third parties, including other websites, services or applications that
        may be linked to or from the Website. You should review the policies of
        such third parties and contact them directly to respond to your
        questions.
      </p>
      <h2>7. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>In Short:</strong> We keep your information for as long as
        necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy notice unless
        otherwise required by law.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is
        necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a
        longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax,
        accounting or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will
        require us keeping your personal information for longer than the period
        of time in which users have an account with us.
      </p>
      <p>
        When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your
        personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such
        information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your
        personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will
        securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further
        processing until deletion is possible.
      </p>
      <h2>8. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>In Short:</strong> We aim to protect your personal information
        through a system of organizational and technical security measures.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security
        measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we
        process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your
        information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information
        storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot
        promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized
        third parties will not be able to defeat our security, and improperly
        collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do
        our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal
        information to and from our Website is at your own risk. You should only
        access the Website within a secure environment.
      </p>
      <h2>9. DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>In Short:</strong> We do not knowingly collect data from or
        market to children under 18 years of age.
      </p>
      <p>
        We do not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under 18
        years of age. By using the Website, you represent that you are at least
        18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to
        such minor dependent’s use of the Website. If we learn that personal
        information from users less than 18 years of age has been collected, we
        will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly
        delete such data from our records. If you become aware of any data we
        may have collected from children under age 18, please contact us at
        __________.

      <p>
        If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information,
        you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. Please note
        however that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing
        before its withdrawal, nor will it affect the processing of your
        personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds
        other than consent.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are a resident in the EEA or UK and you believe we are unlawfully
        processing your personal information, you also have the right to
        complain to your local data protection supervisory authority. You can

        applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can
        activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your
        online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no
        uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals
        has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser
        signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your
        choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is
        adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that
        practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.{' '}
